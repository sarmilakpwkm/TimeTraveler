              Elias Turing had recently graduated from college with a degree in computer science.

                One rainy Tuesday, while searching for his old chess set, he climbed into the dusty attic 
                of his countryside home. Beneath a tarp covered in decades of forgotten memories, 
                he found something impossible: a machine humming softly, covered in dials, wires, 
                and a screen blinking <strong>"SELECT ERA: ▾"</strong>.

                <strong>"WELCOME, DR. TURING. READY FOR ADVENTURE?"</strong>
